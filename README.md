# Module for PrestaShop: Tools to make life easier

## About

This module adds a handful of tools to PrestaShop:

* Disable all countries for shipping (except your country)
* Sort categories alphabetically based on default language
* Remove connection statistics
* Check images are present
* Remove unused images

## History

The module was created back in 2011 but seems to work fine with newer
versions of PrestaShop.

## Installation

Download the ZIP file here from GitHub. Unpack the file to the modules
directory in your shop and rename the directory to get rid of the
"-main" part. Now you can install the module from back office.
