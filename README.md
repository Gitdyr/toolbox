## About

This module adds a handful of tools to PrestaShop:

* Disable all countries for shipping (except your country)

* Remove connection statistics
* Check images are present
* Remove unused images

## History

The module was created back in 2011 but seems to work fine with newer
versions of PrestaShop.
